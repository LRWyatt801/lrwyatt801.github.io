I explored the CPython API by writing C functions to interact with various Python data types. Using the CPython API, I implemented functions to print Python lists, bytes, floats, strings, and integers from within a C program. This project deepened my understanding of how Python objects are represented in memory and how they can be manipulated at the C level. By utilizing PyList_GetItem, PyBytes_AsString, PyFloat_AsDouble, PyUnicode_AsUTF8, and PyLong_AsLong, I was able to extract and display values in a structured manner. This experience reinforced my knowledge of CPython internals and improved my ability to integrate Python with high-performance C code.
